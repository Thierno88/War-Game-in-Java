**War Game Implementation in Java**

This project is a Java-based implementation of the classic board game Risk,but a version played in Brazil called "War", developed as part of an academic assignment during my college studies. The game encompasses all the fundamental rules, including army movements, attacks, and card exchanges, making it a fully functional representation of the original game.

**Key Features:**
- **Complete Rule Implementation:** The game faithfully follows all the rules of War, ensuring a comprehensive gaming experience.
- **Multiplayer Local Mode:** Players can engage in multiplayer matches locally, enhancing the social aspect of the game.
- **MVC Architecture:** The project adopts a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, promoting modularity and maintainability in the codebase.
- **Initialization via ControladorJogo.Java:** The game is initiated through the ControladorJogo.Java file, providing a clear starting point for anyone exploring the code.

**Language and Note:**
- The codebase is primarily in Portuguese, as it was developed for a college assignment. Despite the language choice, the logic and structure of the code should be accessible to developers familiar with Java.

Feel free to explore the code and enjoy a classic game of Risk with a fully functional Java implementation. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
